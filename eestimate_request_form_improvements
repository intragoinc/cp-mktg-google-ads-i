SFDC Logic:

IF Siding is selected THEN
    Primary = Siding

ELSE IF Deck is selected AND Siding is NOT selected THEN
    Primary = Deck

ELSE IF Structures is selected
        AND Siding is NOT selected
        AND Deck is NOT selected THEN
    Primary = Structures

ELSE IF Furniture is selected
        AND Siding is NOT selected
        AND Deck is NOT selected
        AND Structures is NOT selected
        AND Pressure is NOT selected THEN
    Primary = Furniture   // only Furniture

ELSE IF Pressure is selected
        AND Siding is NOT selected
        AND Deck is NOT selected
        AND Structures is NOT selected
        AND Furniture is NOT selected THEN
    Primary = Pressure    // only Pressure

// Otherwise: Primary is intentionally left unset for estimator/system to interpret.
// (but we never have "no surfaces selected" because the form forces ≥ 1 choice)
