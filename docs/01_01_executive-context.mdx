# Executive Context

This document provides the top-level context for the Google Ads initiative. It describes the business motivations, high-level objectives, and phased rollout approach. Subsequent documents provide segmentation, architecture, campaign master specification, landing page specification, and tracking detail.

---

## 1. Business Context

Cal Preserving operates in exterior wood maintenance with service focus on:

- Deck refinishing and repair
- Wood siding refinishing and repair
- Exterior wood structures (fence, trellis, pergola, outdoor furniture)
- Pressure washing (hardscape)
- Catch-all exterior wood restoration

Demand varies by season and geography. Job sizes vary by surface and buyer type. Commercial work has higher ticket value. Residential represents most inbound volume.

---

## 2. Strategic Intent

The initiative is designed to achieve the following:

- Create a repeatable and scalable acquisition channel
- Generate profitable and properly scoped jobs
- Improve geographic mix (Bay Area primary; Fringe secondary)
- Increase commercial share over time
- Support estimator and crew utilization without overload

The system must support long-term optimization rather than short campaigns.

---

## 3. Service Priority

Ordered by revenue potential and operational importance:

1. Deck (highest priority)
2. Siding (high)
3. Structures (medium)
4. Pressure (supporting / lead magnet)
5. Catch-all (discovery coverage)

Furniture exists within structures and remains passive in Phase 1.

---

## 4. Buyer Types

Two primary buyer personas:

- Residential (owners, landlords, renters, buyer/seller cycles)
- Commercial (property managers, HOAs, facilities, boards)

Commercial leads skew larger. Residential drives most inbound activity. Persona split is executed at LP/form level, not keyword level initially.

---

## 5. Geographic Model

Two geographic buckets:

- Bay Area (core)
- Fringe (secondary / extended service range)

Bay Area supports broader service mix and lower minimums. Fringe supports larger jobs and more commercial viability. Same keywords, fewer expansion groups in Fringe.

---

## 6. Sequenced Rollout (High Level)

Three-phased rollout:

**Phase 1 (Core Launch)**  
- Launch Bay Area + Fringe campaigns
- Persona mixed (Residential + Commercial combined)
- LP support for core surfaces
- Single CTA (form)
- Phrase + Exact match
- Negative filtering for DIY/retail/product categories

**Phase 2 (Refinement & Validation)**  
- Adjust budgets based on lead quality + close rate
- Improve negative coverage
- Add attribution and reporting clarity
- Prepare commercial expansion

**Phase 3 (Persona Split)**  
- Split Bay Area + Fringe into Residential vs Commercial
- Add commercial messaging, CTA, and LP variants
- Maintain single CTA (form)
- Sitelinks diverge by persona

---

## 7. Campaign Architecture (Phase Summary)

Same core surfaces across phases:

- Deck
- Siding
- Structures
- Pressure
- Catch-all

Persona split deferred until Phase 3 to reduce surface area at launch.

---

## 8. CTA Model

Single CTA used across all surfaces:

- Residential CTA: `Request a Free Estimate`
- Commercial CTA: `Request a Proposal` (added in Phase 3)

No phone number in ads. Phone appears only on website.

---

## 9. Landing Page Approach

LP ownership by surface and persona:

**Residential**
- Deck
- Siding
- Structures
- Pressure
- Catch-all

**Commercial**
- Deck
- Siding
- Structures
- Pressure
- Catch-all

Commercial LPs introduce different messaging (insurance, risk, board approvals, multi-unit considerations). No image dependencies specified here.

---

## 10. Channel Controls

To improve efficiency and filtering:

- Phrase + Exact match
- Hard negative lists for DIY/retail/composite/product
- No seasonality logic in Phase 1
- No routing logic in scope for this document set

---

## 11. Attribution and Tracking

Attribution will use:

- UTM parameters
- Form fields
- Salesforce lead object tags

Matching to downstream revenue is Phase 2+. Not modeled here.

---

## 12. Output Expectations

This initiative produces:

- Campaign system (not single campaign)
- Documented taxonomy
- Defined LP and CTA model
- Persona separation model
- Geo separation model
- Attribution path for future optimization

---

## 13. Success Criteria (High Level)

Success criteria measured by:

- Cost per qualified lead
- Close rate by surface and geo
- Job size and margin alignment
- Crew and estimator utilization
- Commercial revenue share growth over time

---

## 14. Scope Boundaries

Out-of-scope:

- Creative asset production (imagery)
- Routing complexity
- Automated seasonality controls
- Bid automation beyond Google platform defaults
- Phone-based lead capture within Google Ads

In-scope:

- Campaign architecture
- LP specification
- CTA specification
- Persona split design
- Geo split design
- Keyword + negative modeling

---

## 15. Change Horizon

Expected future extensions:

- Commercial stand-alone campaigns
- Seasonality + capacity budgeting
- Material/Species enrichment
- Reporting automation
- Routing automation
- AI-assisted bid models

These are intentionally deferred until baseline performance is validated.

---

## 16. End State Concept

End state target is a stable, documented, multi-persona, multi-surface, multi-geo advertising system capable of continuous optimization without structural rebuild every season.

Baseline quality must be achieved before capacity scaling or automation.
