# Cal Preserving Google Ads Initiative  
## Part 1.1 — Executive & Context Layer

---

### 1. Purpose

This document defines the **executive context and rationale** for the Google Ads initiative. It explains what the system is intended to achieve, why it is being implemented, and what outcomes determine success.

---

### 2. Business Context

Cal Preserving operates in the Bay Area with specialization in:

- Exterior wood preservation
- Refinishing, repair, and protection
- High-value surfaces such as decks and wood siding

Demand historically originates from:

- Organic search
- Reputation / referrals
- Property transactions
- Seasonal maintenance cycles

The Google Ads initiative is intended to introduce a **repeatable, controllable paid demand channel** that retains alignment with operational constraints (crew capacity, geography, minimums, estimator load).

---

### 3. Strategic Objectives

The initiative supports four primary objectives:

**3.1 Business Objectives**
- Increase booked revenue in profitable service categories
- Expand mix toward larger and more complex jobs
- Protect minimum economics in Fringe geographies
- Enable selective growth of commercial work

**3.2 Marketing Objectives**
- Capture high intent searches for restoration and refinishing services
- Improve clarity around service capabilities (wood → not composite)
- Establish competitive positioning in premium surfaces (deck, siding)

**3.3 Operational Objectives**
- Reduce scheduling inefficiency from low-value distant jobs
- Improve estimator workflow via better lead qualification
- Support future scaling without full system rebuild

---

### 4. Initiative Scope

The initiative includes the following workstreams:

- Campaign architecture
- Keyword and negative keyword strategy
- Landing page alignment
- CTA and messaging alignment
- Geo segmentation (Bay Area → Fringe → Persona split later)
- Attribution and performance reporting
- Budget planning and continuous optimization

Routing, Salesforce customization, and phone-based attribution are **explicitly out of scope** for this phase of the initiative.

---

### 5. Campaign Surfaces (Service Model)

Five primary service surfaces are in scope:

1. Deck
2. Siding
3. Structures (Fence + Furniture + Exterior Wood Structures)
4. Pressure (Hardscape pressure washing)
5. Catch-All (Exterior wood / long tail)

This surface model aligns with real buyer queries and estimator workflows.

---

### 6. Geographic Model

Two core geographies:

- **Bay Area** (primary service region)
- **Fringe** (extended service region with higher minimums)

Geography impacts:

- Job size thresholds
- Crew routing viability
- Estimator productivity
- Budget weighting

---

### 7. Phased Deployment

Deployment occurs in three controlled phases:

- **Phase 1:** Bay Area + Residential (baseline launch)
- **Phase 2:** Bay Area + Fringe + Residential (regional expansion)
- **Phase 3:** Bay Area + Fringe + Residential + Commercial (persona expansion)

Each phase increases sophistication without requiring rework of earlier layers.

---

### 8. Expected Outcomes

The initiative is successful if:

- Lead volume increases in profitable surfaces
- Close rates and job sizes support sustainable CACs
- Spend migrates toward geographies and services with best economics
- System remains maintainable and extensible into commercial work

---

### 9. Summary

This initiative is not a one-off advertising campaign. It is the construction of an **ongoing demand generation system** that aligns paid acquisition with internal business constraints and long-term revenue goals.
