## **1. Overview Narrative (Short)**
Residential inquiries come from homeowners, landlords, and renters for exterior wood surfaces including decks, siding, fences, furniture, and exterior structures in the Bay Area. Demand is driven by a mix of aesthetic goals ("make it look new again") and functional/safety issues ("splintering", "rot", "slippery"). Weather, seasonality, and outdoor lifestyle influence urgency, along with property enjoyment and curb appeal.

The buyer is not always the resident; renters often generate the inbound inquiry, landlords make financial decisions, and owners ultimately approve work. Price sensitivity varies with surface type, job size, and season. Residential is a higher-volume, medium-ticket market ideal for consistent capacity utilization.

---

## **2. Job To Be Done (JTBD)**
> “Help me restore, protect, or fix my exterior wood so my property looks good, feels safe, and lasts longer.”

---

## **3. Core Motivations**
Primary:
- Improve appearance
- Increase enjoyment of outdoor space
- Maintain property value
- Avoid embarrassment (curb appeal / guests)
- Extend lifespan of wood

Secondary:
- Safety for children / pets
- Preparing for events (parties, holidays)
- Preparing to sell or rent

---

## **4. Pain Points**
- Wood looks dull, faded, grey, or damaged
- Splintering or loose boards
- Areas are slippery when wet
- Mold/mildew on furniture or decks
- Staining not lasting as long as expected
- Hard to DIY / poor past DIY results

---

## **5. Buying Triggers / Events**
Event-Level Triggers:
- End of rainy season
- Before summer outdoor season
- After storms (damage/safety)
- Move-in / move-out
- HOA notice
- Listing home for sale

Seasonal Triggers:
- Q2 = upgrade/refinish peak
- Q1 = repair/furniture peak (rainy season)
- Q3 = maintenance + enjoyment
- Q4 = protective prep before winter

---

## **6. Evaluation Criteria (Ranked)**
1. Quality of final appearance
2. Durability / longevity of finish
3. Price / perceived value
4. Scheduling & convenience
5. Use of correct materials/products
6. Reputation & reviews
7. Warranty / workmanship guarantees

---

## **7. Objections & Frictions**
- “That seems expensive for just staining.”
- “Can I just do this myself?”
- “Why do you have a minimum?”
- “Will it last more than one season?”
- “My last staining didn’t hold up.”
- “Do you fix boards too or just stain?”
- “Do I need to replace wood first?”

---

## **8. Messaging DOs**
- Do emphasize the transformation
- Do show before/after visuals
- Do highlight species expertise (Redwood, Cedar, IPE, Teak)
- Do emphasize longevity + protection
- Do normalize minimum job sizes on LP (not ad)
- Do communicate clear next steps
- Do frame value over price

---

## **9. Messaging DON'Ts**
- Don’t talk about “proposals” or “RFPs”
- Don’t overemphasize insurance/compliance (not primary factor)
- Don’t anchor price in ads
- Don’t create commitment friction (avoid “book crew now”)
- Don’t use commercial language like “bid cycles”

---

## **10. Value Wedges (Differentiation)**
- Wood species expertise
- Correct product selection for Bay Area climate
- Rain + UV protection framing
- Safety improvement
- Restoration vs simple cleaning
- Single-vendor solution (repair + refinish)

---

## **11. CTA Preferences**
Best CTA:
> **Request a Free Estimate**

Acceptable Alternatives:
> Get a Quote  
> Request Pricing  

Avoid at Phase-1:
> Submit Proposal  
> Bid Request  
> Book Crew  
> Call for RFP  

---

## **12. Seasonal Notes**
Residential demand is highly seasonal with strong peaks aligned to outdoor usage:

- Q2-Q3 = refinish peak
- Q1 = repair + furniture peak (rainy season)
- Q4 = protective prep

Rainy-season furniture refinishing is a powerful anti-seasonality tool.

---

## **13. Price Sensitivity**
- Medium to High
- Higher sensitivity for fences + furniture
- Lower sensitivity for decks + siding
- High objection to minimum job sizes (handled on LP, not ads)

---

## **14. Disqualifiers / Estimator Filters**
Residential disqualifiers include:
- Job size below minimum (LP handles this)
- Inability to schedule access
- No financial decision maker available
- Full replacement required (refer out)
- Severe structural damage requiring carpentry/engineering

---

## **15. Notes for LP Writers**
LP Should:
- Use before/after imagery
- Segment surfaces (Deck / Siding / Structures / Furniture / Pressure)
- Explain repair + refinish sequencing
- Address lifespan & maintenance expectations
- Answer “DIY vs Pro” implicitly

LP Should Not:
- Ask for too many fields in form
- Require uploading photos on first submission
- Force job sizing too early in flow

---

## **16. Notes for RSA Writers**
RSA copy should:
- Support both Aesthetic & Repair intent
- Mention species where relevant
- Avoid commercial procurement language
- Use soft, low-friction CTA
- Focus on benefits + longevity + enjoyment + safety

Example messaging wedges:
- “Restore the beauty of natural wood.”
- “Protect against rain, sun & mildew.”
- “Fix splintering & loose boards.”

---

## **17. Notes for Estimators**
Residential estimator posture:
- Educational > transactional
- Visual inspection drives scope
- Upsell opportunities = refinishing after repairs
- Expect photo submission follow-ups
- High variance in job size -> qualify gently

---

## **18. Lead Journey Summary**
Typical Funnel:
Inquiry → Estimate → Approval → Crew → Final Walk → Review

Time Sensitivity:
Medium — driven by weather and outdoor use windows

---

## **19. Qualification Summary**
Residential = High Volume / Medium Ticket / Medium CAC / Low LTV

Beneficial for:
- capacity fill
- seasonality smoothing
- covering fixed estimator overhead
