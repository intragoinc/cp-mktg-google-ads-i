## Module 6 – FAQs

**Do you work with property management companies and HOAs?**  
Yes. Many of our commercial projects are managed through PM firms or HOA boards.

**Can you schedule work during lower-traffic hours?**  
Yes. We’ll discuss options during the site walk and plan accordingly.

**Is this suitable as a one-time project or ongoing maintenance?**  
Both. We can perform one-time cleaning or discuss a recurring schedule that fits your property.

**Do you clean building exteriors or roofs?**  
Our focus is on pedestrian hardscape surfaces. House washing and roofs are not our primary service.
