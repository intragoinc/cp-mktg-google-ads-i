# Part 2.1 — Segmentation & Taxonomy Model

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **canonical segmentation and taxonomy model** for the Cal Preserving Google Ads system.

It is the **source of truth** for:

- Campaign design  
- CSV masters (Phase 1–3)  
- Landing page mapping  
- CTA rules  
- Persona behavior  
- Geo behavior  
- Reporting keys  

Routing, Salesforce configuration, and phone-based attribution are **out of scope** here.

---

## 2. Core Dimensions

The system is built on six core segmentation dimensions:

1. **Phase** — rollout stage of the system  
2. **Geo** — bay_area vs fringe  
3. **Persona** — residential vs commercial (Phase 3 only)  
4. **Surface** — deck, siding, structures, pressure, catch_all  
5. **Campaign Concept** — combination of geo + surface (+ persona in Phase 3)  
6. **Keyword Intent** — repair / restoration / maintenance / finishing / species / pressure / generic / catch_all

These dimensions must remain stable across:

- Google Ads campaigns and ad groups  
- CSV master files  
- Landing page structure  
- Reporting and dashboards  

---

## 3. Canonical Enums

### 3.1 Phase

Internal phase identifiers:

```txt
phase_1   // Bay Area only, Residential (implicit)
phase_2   // Bay Area + Fringe, Residential (implicit)
phase_3   // Bay Area + Fringe, Residential + Commercial (explicit personas)
```

In CSVs this may be represented as `1`, `2`, `3` or `phase_1`, `phase_2`, `phase_3`.  
The important part is consistent usage.

---

### 3.2 Geo

Canonical **geo** enum:

```txt
bay_area
fringe
```

Usage:

- **Phase 1** → `bay_area` only  
- **Phase 2** → `bay_area`, `fringe`  
- **Phase 3** → `bay_area`, `fringe` (same, but now combined with personas)

---

### 3.3 Persona

Canonical **persona** enum (Phase 3 only):

```txt
residential
commercial
```

Usage by phase:

- **Phase 1**: persona dimension not used (assume residential)  
- **Phase 2**: persona dimension not used (assume residential)  
- **Phase 3**: persona dimension is explicit and required

---

### 3.4 Surface

Canonical **surface** enum:

```txt
deck
siding
structures
pressure
catch_all
```

Definitions:

- `deck` — decks, railings, stairs, balconies  
- `siding` — wood siding, cladding, facades  
- `structures` — fences, gates, trellis, arbors, pergolas, gazebos, patio furniture  
- `pressure` — **hardscape-only pressure washing** (concrete, stone, patios, etc.)  
- `catch_all` — exterior wood restoration/repair queries that do not fit neatly into a single surface

---

### 3.5 CTA

Canonical **CTA** enum (for LP + ads alignment):

```txt
request_free_estimate   // Residential
request_proposal        // Commercial
```

Rules:

- `residential` → `request_free_estimate`  
- `commercial` → `request_proposal`  

Phone calls appear on the website, but **no phone number appears in Google Ads ad copy**.

---

### 3.6 Sitelinks

Canonical **sitelink labels**:

```txt
process
gallery
faq
request_free_estimate   // Residential
request_proposal        // Commercial
```

Mapping:

- Residential sitelinks:
  - Process
  - Gallery
  - FAQ
  - Request a Free Estimate

- Commercial sitelinks:
  - Process
  - Gallery
  - FAQ
  - Request a Proposal

Sitelinks are shared across surfaces; text applies at the service-line level, not deeply surface-specific.

---

## 4. Phase Behavior

### 4.1 Phase 1 — Baseline Launch

**Scope:**

- Geo: `bay_area` only  
- Persona: implicit residential (no persona column required)  
- Surfaces: `deck`, `siding`, `structures`, `pressure`, `catch_all`  
- LPs: Residential only (one LP per surface)  
- CTA: `request_free_estimate` everywhere  
- Sitelinks: Residential set  
- Campaigns: grouped by `geo + surface`

Example campaign concepts (logical):

- `bay_area_deck`
- `bay_area_siding`
- `bay_area_structures`
- `bay_area_pressure`
- `bay_area_catch_all`

Phase 1 is the minimal viable structure that matches your current CSV master.

---

### 4.2 Phase 2 — Geo Expansion (Fringe)

**Scope:**

- Geo: `bay_area`, `fringe`  
- Persona: still implicit residential  
- Surfaces: same 5  
- LPs: still Residential-only  
- CTA: `request_free_estimate`  
- Sitelinks: Residential set  
- Campaigns: now `geo + surface` for both geos

Example campaign concepts:

- `bay_area_deck`, `fringe_deck`
- `bay_area_siding`, `fringe_siding`
- etc.

Fringe runs more selective ad groups and budget weighting, but taxonomy remains identical.

---

### 4.3 Phase 3 — Persona Expansion

**Scope:**

- Geo: `bay_area`, `fringe`
- Persona: `residential`, `commercial`
- Surfaces: same 5
- LPs: now **duplicated** by persona (2 × 5 = 10 LPs)
- CTA:
  - `residential` → `request_free_estimate`
  - `commercial` → `request_proposal`
- Sitelinks:
  - Residential sitelinks for residential persona
  - Commercial sitelinks for commercial persona
- Campaigns: now segmented by `geo + surface + persona`

Example campaign concepts:

- `bay_area_deck_residential`
- `bay_area_deck_commercial`
- `fringe_siding_residential`
- `fringe_siding_commercial`
- etc.

Phase 3 is deployed **all at once** (not staggered inside the phase).

---

## 5. Campaign Concept Model

### 5.1 Canonical Campaign Key

The **logical key** for a campaign is:

```txt
campaign_key = geo + "_" + surface [+ "_" + persona_in_phase3]
```

Examples:

- Phase 1 / 2:
  - `bay_area_deck`
  - `fringe_siding`
  - `bay_area_catch_all`

- Phase 3:
  - `bay_area_deck_residential`
  - `bay_area_deck_commercial`
  - `fringe_pressure_residential`
  - `fringe_catch_all_commercial`

This key should map directly to:

- Google Ads campaign name (human-readable variant)  
- CSV master column grouping  
- LP selection logic  
- Reporting aggregation  

---

### 5.2 Ad Group Model

Within each campaign, ad groups are segmented mainly by:

- **Keyword intent**
- **Surface subtype or species** (when applicable)

Examples (for `bay_area_deck_residential`):

- `Deck Repair and Maintenance`
- `Deck Staining and Sealing`
- `Premium Wood Deck Restoration`
- `Hardwood Deck Restoration`
- `Redwood Deck Refinishing`
- etc.

Exact wording may differ, but the **intent family** must be stable.

---

## 6. Keyword Intent Taxonomy

Keyword intent families underpin ad groups and RSA variants.

### 6.1 Intent Families (High Level)

```txt
repair_maintenance     // “repair”, “maintenance”, “fix”, “restore”
finishing_protection   // “refinishing”, “staining”, “sealing”, “coating”
species_premium        // “redwood”, “cedar”, “ipe”, “teak”, “hardwood”
pressure_hardscape     // “concrete pressure washing”, “patio cleaning”
generic_restoration    // “wood restoration”, “exterior wood services”
catch_all              // broad exterior wood queries
```

These are conceptual labels; in your CSV master, intent is expressed through **ad group name + keyword list**.

---

### 6.2 Match Types

For Phase 1–3, the default strategy:

- **Exact + Phrase**  
- No Broad match in baseline design  
- Negative keywords handle retail/composite/DIY

---

### 6.3 Composite / DIY / Retail Negatives

Global negative patterns include:

- DIY / “how to”
- “cheap”, “free”
- “home depot”, “lowes”, “menards”, “amazon”, etc.
- Materials-only / kits / prefab / prebuilt
- Composite brands and non-wood materials:
  - Trex, TimberTech, Azek, Fiberon
  - Fiber cement, Hardie, James Hardie, LP SmartSide
  - PVC, vinyl, plastic, resin
  - Metal, aluminum, steel, iron, wrought iron

These are applied at **campaign negative** level as per CSV master.

---

## 7. LP & CTA Mapping

### 7.1 Landing Page Matrix

LPs are defined by:

- surface
- persona (Phase 3 only)

Canonical LP key:

```txt
lp_key = persona + "_" + surface   // Phase 3
lp_key = surface                   // Phase 1–2
```

Conceptual LP URLs (implementation-specific):

```txt
/residential/deck
/residential/siding
/residential/structures
/residential/pressure
/residential/catch-all

/commercial/deck
/commercial/siding
/commercial/structures
/commercial/pressure
/commercial/catch-all
```

(Exact paths are flexible; consistency is the requirement.)

---

### 7.2 CTA Rules

Mapping:

- `persona = residential` → CTA button text: **“Request a Free Estimate”**
- `persona = commercial` → CTA button text: **“Request a Proposal”**

This appears:

- On LP primary CTA  
- In RSAs (where CTA-like language is used in description text or headlines)  

No phone numbers appear in ad copy.

---

### 7.3 Sitelink Rules

**Residential:**

- Process
- Gallery
- FAQ
- Request a Free Estimate

**Commercial:**

- Process
- Gallery
- FAQ
- Request a Proposal

Sitelink naming is normalized; underlying URLs can point to:

- `/process`
- `/gallery`
- `/faq`
- `/estimate` or `/proposal`

---

## 8. Persona Behavior by Phase

### 8.1 Phase 1 & 2

- Persona not explicit in campaigns or CSVs
- LPs use Residential tone by default
- Commercial inquiries arrive implicitly through generic terms
- No persona-based reporting dimension (only inferred)

### 8.2 Phase 3

- Persona is explicit in:
  - Campaign naming
  - CSV master (`persona` column)
  - LP selection
  - CTA wording
  - Sitelinks

- Reporting gains:
  - `service × geo × persona` lens

---

## 9. Alignment with CSV Masters

### 9.1 Required Columns (Phase 3 CSVs)

Baseline header (example you already chose):

```txt
campaign,persona,geo,surface,phase,ad_group,keyword,match_type,
ad_group_negatives,campaign_negatives,lp_url,cta,sitelinks
```

Alignment rules:

- `campaign` → human-readable name, derived from `geo + surface + persona`  
- `persona` → `residential` or `commercial` (Phase 3 only; blank or omitted in Phases 1–2)  
- `geo` → `bay_area` or `fringe`  
- `surface` → `deck`, `siding`, `structures`, `pressure`, `catch_all`  
- `phase` → `1`, `2`, or `3` (or `phase_1` etc., but must be consistent)  
- `lp_url` → stable LP path as per mapping rules  
- `cta` → `request_free_estimate` or `request_proposal`  
- `sitelinks` → a list or encoded structure (e.g. `process;gallery;faq;request_free_estimate`)  

### 9.2 Backwards Compatibility

Phase 1 and 2 CSVs:

- May omit `persona` or fill as `residential` consistently  
- `geo` and `surface` must still conform to enums  
- `cta` can be uniformly `request_free_estimate`  
- `sitelinks` can be uniformly residential set  

---

## 10. Non-Goals

This taxonomy intentionally **does not** cover:

- Salesforce object model or routing rules  
- Phone call attribution configuration  
- Seasonality pacing or scheduling  
- Bid strategy tuning over time  

Those can be layered later without altering the base segmentation model.

---

## 11. Summary

This Segmentation & Taxonomy model defines:

- Canonical enums for **geo**, **persona**, **surface**, **CTA**, and **sitelinks**  
- Phase-dependent behavior for campaigns and LPs  
- How CSV masters should be structured  
- How future layers (LP, RSA, reporting) align without rework  

All future documents in `/docs` and all CSVs in `/doc2` should remain consistent with these definitions.
