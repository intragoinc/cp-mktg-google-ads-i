## Section 1 – When It’s Time to Refinish Your Siding

Signs your siding needs attention:

- Faded, uneven or chalky finish  
- Dark streaks, mildew or algae  
- Peeling or failed coatings  
- Exposed end-grain taking on water  
- Previous stain no longer protecting the wood  

Left alone, moisture can get behind siding and cause more serious damage.
