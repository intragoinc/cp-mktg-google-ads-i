# Cal Preserving — Google Ads Build + Optimization Initiative (Phases 1–3)

## 1. Overview

Cal Preserving is launching a structured, multi-phase Google Ads initiative to increase high-value exterior wood restoration work across the Bay Area, while protecting margins and estimator capacity.

This initiative replaces ad-hoc campaigns with a **designed system** that can be rolled out in three phases, tuned using real performance data, and extended over time.

- **Phase 1:** Bay Area only, residential-focused campaigns (no explicit persona split in Google Ads).
- **Phase 2:** Bay Area + Fringe, residential-focused campaigns (no explicit persona split, but geo differences).
- **Phase 3:** Bay Area + Fringe, full **Residential vs Commercial** persona split throughout campaigns and landing pages.

This document is written as an **internal initiative plan** for the Marketing Team, and is designed to coordinate work between:

- **Marketing Team** – owns strategy, campaign structure, keywords, budgets, and optimization.
- **Web Team** – owns landing page implementation, forms, tracking snippets, and basic QA.
- **Salesforce Team** – owns CRM ingestion, lead creation, and downstream reporting initiatives (in separate Salesforce-specific initiatives).

---

## 2. Strategic Context

Cal Preserving operates in a specialized niche: **high-quality exterior wood restoration** (decks, siding, fences, wood structures, furniture, hardscape pressure washing).

Key realities:

- Jobs are **high ticket** but operationally complex.
- Travel time, crew routing, and job size economics are critical.
- Residential vs Commercial / HOA / Property Manager buyers behave differently.
- There is strong organic and referral demand, but paid demand needs structure and discipline.

The Google Ads system must:

1. Produce **more of the right leads**:
   - The right **services** (deck, siding, structures, pressure, catch-all).
   - The right **geos** (Bay Area vs Fringe).
   - The right **buyer types** (residential vs commercial, in Phase 3).

2. Avoid flooding estimators with low-value or off-target leads.

3. Be traceable and maintainable:
   - Every campaign, ad group, and keyword should map cleanly to a documented taxonomy.
   - Landing pages and forms should be consistent and phase-stable.

This initiative assumes that **Salesforce attribution, reporting enhancements, and post-lead optimization** will be handled in **separate initiatives** (e.g., “Salesforce Attribution Initiative”), while this document focuses on:
- Campaign structure,
- Landing page strategy,
- Phased rollout,
- Ongoing optimization from a paid media perspective.

## 3. Business Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Objectives

- Increase **high-value booked jobs** for:
  - Deck restoration and refinishing.
  - Wood siding restoration and maintenance.
  - Selected structures (fences, trellises, pergolas, gazebos).
  - Hardscape pressure washing when it supports core wood jobs or stands alone with adequate job size.
- Move toward a **healthy mix of Residential and Commercial** work over time, targeting an approximate **60% Residential / 40% Commercial** balance once the system is fully matured.

### 3.2 Supporting Objectives

- Protect minimum job size economics, especially in **Fringe** geos.
- Improve lead quality by:
  - Intent-focused keyword design (restoration, refinishing, repair, preservation).
  - Strong negative keyword lists (DIY, retail, materials-only, composites, low-intent searches).
- Build a structure that:
  - Can scale budgets up/down without structural redesign.
  - Survives Google product changes (match type evolution, campaign settings, etc.).

---

## 4. Scope of Work (Marketing-Led Initiative)

### 4.1 In Scope (for this Initiative)

- Overall **Google Ads account architecture** (Phases 1–3).
- Campaign / ad group design aligned to:
  - Service (**Deck**, **Siding**, **Wood Structures & Furniture**, **Pressure**, **Catch-All**).
  - Geography (**Bay Area**, and later **Fringe**).
  - Persona (**Residential vs Commercial** in Phase 3).
- Keyword strategy:
  - Phrase + Exact match.
  - Negative keyword design (campaign and ad group level).
- Landing page alignment:
  - Mapping campaigns to **Residential vs Commercial** LPs by surface.
  - Keeping LP URL structures maintainable and SEO-aware.
- Baseline optimization plan:
  - Query review.
  - Negative keyword refinement.
  - Budget reallocation based on early performance.
- Collaboration with Web and Salesforce teams on **requirements**, but **not** doing implementation in those systems.

### 4.2 Out of Scope (Handled by Other Initiatives / Teams)

These are explicitly **non-scope** for this initiative and will be handled elsewhere:

- Salesforce attribution plumbing and reporting dashboards.
- SEO content strategy for the main marketing site.
- Complex automation (lead scoring, nurture sequences, etc.).

---

## 5. Success Criteria (Marketing View)

From a marketing and paid media perspective, this initiative is successful when:

- There is a **clean, documented mapping** between:
  - Campaigns in Google Ads.
  - Surfaces (Deck, Siding, Structures, Furniture, Pressure, Catch-All).
  - Personas (Residential, Commercial – Phase 3).
  - Landing pages and CTAs.
- Phase 1 and 2 launches occur close to the targeted windows:
  - Phase 1: within ~1-2 weeks.
  - Phase 2: within ~3–4 weeks after Phase 1.
- Phase 3 persona split is fully designed and launched within ~3–4 weeks after Phase 2.
- The system can be optimized with **light, ongoing effort** (no major structural rebuilds) over the first 3–6 months.

Final success will also depend on Salesforce reporting and actual job economics, but that is purposely owned by Salesforce-focused initiatives.

## 7. Build Architecture (Phases 1–3)

### 7.1 Core Surfaces

All phases use the same **core service surfaces**:

- **Deck**
- **Siding**
- **Wood Structures** (fences, trellises, gazebos, pergolas, etc.)
- **Furniture** (teak / hardwood patio sets – may be treated as an add-on within structures in early phases)
- **Pressure** (hardscape pressure washing)
- **Catch-All** (general exterior wood restoration queries)

### 7.2 Phase 1 — Campaign Structure (Bay Area Only, Residential-Focused)

**Goal:** Go live quickly with a clean, residential-focused structure for the Bay Area, without explicit persona split in the campaigns.

- Campaigns (examples):
  - `Bay Area Deck`
  - `Bay Area Siding`
  - `Bay Area Wood Structures`
  - `Bay Area Pressure`
  - `Bay Area Exterior Wood (Catch-all)`

- Landing Pages:
  - `/residential/deck/`
  - `/residential/siding/`
  - `/residential/wood-structures/`
  - `/residential/pressure/`
  - `/residential/` (Catch-all)

- Persona handling:
  - The form collects **Property Type** and related fields, but campaigns remain mixed persona in Google Ads.
  - Marketing uses form data for analysis; persona-specific campaigns are deferred to Phase 3.

### 7.3 Phase 2 — Add Fringe Geos (Still Residential-Focused)

**Goal:** Extend the same surface-based structure to **Fringe** geos with adjusted budgets and minimum job expectations.

- Campaign pairs:
  - `Bay Area Deck` + (future) `Fringe Deck`
  - `Bay Area Siding` + `Fringe Siding`
  - `Bay Area Wood Structures` + `Fringe Wood Structures`
  - `Bay Area Pressure` + `Fringe Pressure`
  - `Bay Area Exterior Wood (Catch-all)` + `Fringe Exterior Wood (Catch-all)`

- LP strategy:
  - Still uses the same `/residential/...` LPs.
  - Geo differences are handled in campaign targeting and budget allocation.

- Focus:
  - Protect estimator time and job size economics in Fringe.
  - Allow more budget in Bay Area where routing is easier.

### 7.4 Phase 3 — Full Persona Split (Residential & Commercial)

**Goal:** Introduce explicit **Residential vs Commercial** personas in the Google Ads structure, while reusing the same surfaces and LP logic.

- Campaign dimensions now include:
  - **Persona:** Residential vs Commercial.
  - **Geo:** Bay Area vs Fringe.
  - **Surface:** Deck, Siding, Wood Structures, Pressure, Catch-All.

- Example campaign names:
  - `Bay Area Deck – Residential`
  - `Bay Area Deck – Commercial`
  - `Fringe Siding – Residential`
  - `Fringe Siding – Commercial`
  - …etc.

- Landing Pages:
  - Residential:
    - `/residential/deck/`
    - `/residential/siding/`
    - `/residential/wood-structures/`
    - `/residential/pressure/`
    - `/residential/` (Catch-all)
  - Commercial:
    - `/commercial/deck/`
    - `/commercial/siding/`
    - `/commercial/wood-structures/`
    - `/commercial/pressure/`
    - `/commercial/` (Catch-all)

- CTAs:
  - Residential LPs: **“Request a Free Estimate”**
  - Commercial LPs: **“Request a Proposal”**

## 8. Launch Plan & Timeline

### 8.1 Targeted Rollout

This initiative assumes an assertive but realistic rollout:

- **Phase 1:** 7–15 days
- **Phase 2:** 3–4 weeks after Phase 1
- **Phase 3:** 3–4 weeks after Phase 2

These are relative ranges; exact dates are set by the Marketing Team based on workload and dependencies.

### 8.2 Phase 1 — Checklist

- Finalize and confirm:
  - `campaign_master_phase1.csv`
  - LP mapping for Phase 1.
  - Estimate Request Form spec (v1) and implementation on key LPs.
- Build and QA:
  - Campaigns and ad groups in Google Ads (Bay Area only).
  - Initial RSA ad assets aligned to each surface.
- Smoke test:
  - Click → LP → form submission path.
  - Web-to-lead PHP bridge to Salesforce (at least basic success path).

### 8.3 Phase 2 — Checklist

- Duplicate Phase 1 structure into **Fringe** variations.
- Confirm:
  - `campaign_master_phase2.csv`
  - Budget split between Bay Area and Fringe per surface.
- Launch Fringe campaigns only after:
  - Phase 1 data shows stable funnel behavior.
  - Minimum job logic is clear to estimators and scheduling.

### 8.4 Phase 3 — Checklist

- Confirm persona split design:
  - `campaign_master_phase3.csv` and its Bay Area / Fringe + Residential / Commercial variants.
- Implement or verify:
  - Persona-specific LPs at `/residential/...` and `/commercial/...` paths.
  - Property Type and relationship fields are stable in Salesforce.
- Launch Phase 3 only when:
  - LP content for commercial personas clearly addresses multi-unit, HOA, facilities, and property manager concerns.
  - The team can meaningfully interpret residential vs commercial performance differences.

---

## 9. Optimization Plan (Light, Ongoing)

This initiative includes **light ongoing optimization**, not a heavy retainer. Core activities:

1. **Search term review:**
   - Add new negatives for persistent bad queries.
   - Identify new positive themes that may warrant new ad groups later.

2. **Budget reallocation:**
   - Shift budget toward higher-performing surfaces and geos.
   - Cap or trim poor-performing combinations.

3. **Asset tuning:**
   - Iterate RSA headlines and descriptions based on engagement and early conversion signals.

4. **Structural stability:**
   - Avoid frequent structural changes; prioritize consistency so that downstream reporting (Salesforce initiatives) has a stable base.

---

## 10. Risks & Mitigation (Marketing Perspective)

- **Risk: Over-fragmentation too early.**  
  *Mitigation:* Keep Phase 1 and 2 structures relatively simple; delay full persona split to Phase 3.

- **Risk: Misalignment between LPs and campaigns.**  
  *Mitigation:* Maintain and version LP mapping CSVs (`lp_mapping_phaseX.csv`) and keep them in the same repo as docs.

- **Risk: Confusion about ownership (Marketing vs Web vs Salesforce).**  
  *Mitigation:* Keep this initiative explicitly scoped to paid media and LP requirements; treat Salesforce reporting as a separate initiative.

- **Risk: Slow rollout due to cross-team dependencies.**  
  *Mitigation:* Phase 1 can launch on a subset of LPs and gradually expand; avoid bundling all improvements into a single “big bang”.

## 11. Future Salesforce & Reporting Initiatives (Reference Only)

The following are intentionally **not included** in this initiative but are expected to exist as separate efforts:

- **Salesforce Attribution Initiative**  
  - Design and implement robust UTM mapping, campaign field strategy, and lead-to-opportunity attribution.

- **Salesforce Reporting Initiative**  
  - Build dashboards tying Google Ads spend to job size, margin, and close rate by surface, geo, and persona.

- **CRM Enrichment Initiative**  
  - Enhance lead and account records with additional fields and categorizations for better segmentation.

- **Post-Lead Optimization Initiative**  
  - Improve follow-up cadences, nurture flows, and reactivation strategies based on lead quality bands.

Each of these can treat this Google Ads Build + Optimization Initiative as a **foundation layer**.

---

## 12. Glossary

- **Bay Area:** Core service geography with favorable routing and density.
- **Fringe:** Outlying geos where job size and travel time need stricter economics.
- **Surface:** The primary physical area to be restored (deck, siding, wood structures, furniture, pressure, catch-all).
- **Persona:** Residential vs Commercial buyer type (explicit in Phase 3).
- **LP (Landing Page):** A page designed for a specific surface and persona, with a single primary CTA.
- **CTA:** Call to action (“Request a Free Estimate” for Residential, “Request a Proposal” for Commercial).
- **Phase 1 / 2 / 3:** Sequential build and optimization stages for geo and persona maturity.
