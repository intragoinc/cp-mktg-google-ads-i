# Part 1.6 — Persona Model

---

## 1. Overview

Cal Preserving sells to two structurally different buyer types:

- **Residential**
- **Commercial / HOA / Property Management**

Personas influence messaging, landing pages, form language, and later bidding. They **do not** fragment campaigns prematurely.

---

## 2. Persona Definitions (Phase Model)

Personas activate gradually:

| Phase | Residential | Commercial |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** | Active | Passive (served implicitly) |
| **Phase 2** | Active | Passive (targeted via intent) |
| **Phase 3** | Active | **Active (fully split)** |

This approach preserves efficiency while allowing learnings to accumulate before splitting spend.

---

## 3. Residential Persona

Residential buyers are typically:

- Individual homeowners
- Renters with decision authority
- New purchasers prepping properties
- Sellers preparing listings

They care about:

- Aesthetics and lifestyle use (deck seasonality)
- Home value preservation
- Visible degradation (peeling, graying, mildew)
- Trust, craftsmanship, and insurance
- Cost and timing

They rarely know species precisely (“Ipe deck” vs “hardwood deck”), and are less likely to specify:

- Coatings
- Prep methods
- Maintenance cycles

Residential persona language benefits from:

- Before/after visuals
- Gallery credibility
- Project timelines
- Warranty/protection framing

CTA: **Request a Free Estimate**

---

## 4. Commercial Persona

Commercial / HOA / PM buyers include:

- Property managers
- Facility managers
- Board/HOA decision groups
- Multi-unit residential owners
- Developers and asset managers

They care about:

- Risk mitigation
- Insurance and compliance
- Scheduling around tenants/residents
- Documentation and communication
- Long-term durability and maintenance cycles
- Disruption minimization
- Vendor reliability

They are less price-sensitive and more focused on:

- Project management
- Documentation
- Workmanship guarantees

CTA: **Request a Proposal**

---

## 5. Messaging Differentiation

Surface is constant across both personas. Messaging differs on:

| Dimension | Residential | Commercial |
|---|---|---|
| Motivation | Home improvement | Asset protection |
| Stakeholder | Owner / Resident | PM / Board / Ops |
| Risk Lens | Aesthetics + safety | Compliance + liability |
| Time Lens | Seasonal | Multi-year |
| Proof Lens | Visuals | Documentation |
| Social Proof | Reviews | References |
| Price | Budget-conscious | Budget-justified |

Differentiation activates at the **LP layer**, not campaign layer until Phase 3.

---

## 6. Persona in Forms

Forms are universal, variation is minimal:

| Field Element | Residential | Commercial |
|---|---|---|
| CTA | Free Estimate | Proposal |
| Surfaces | Same | Same |
| When | Same | Same |
| Property Type | Optional | Optional (supports PM/HOA qualification) |

No routing logic required in early phases.

---

## 7. Persona in Campaign Architecture

Campaign impact staged as follows:

**Phase 1–2 (Efficiency Mode)**

- Campaigns combine both personas implicitly
- Landing page does not explicitly speak commercial
- Queries like “hoa deck restoration” still convert via generic LP

**Phase 3 (Split Mode)**

Campaigns split by persona:

Deck — Residential — Bay Area
Deck — Commercial — Bay Area
Deck — Residential — Fringe
Deck — Commercial — Fringe

This unlocks differentiated:

- Ad copy
- LPs
- CTA
- Sitelinks
- Bid strategies if later desired

---

## 8. Persona & Surface Matrix

The full surface × persona matrix in Phase 3 is:

| Surface | Residential | Commercial |
|---|---|---|
| Deck | Yes | Yes |
| Siding | Yes | Yes |
| Structures | Yes | Yes |
| Pressure | Yes | Yes |
| Catch-All | Yes | Yes |

This produces **10 LPs** in Phase 3.

---

## 9. Persona & Geo Model

Persona and geography do not conflict.

Phase 3 yields:

| Geo | Residential | Commercial |
|---|---|---|
| Bay Area | Yes | Yes |
| Fringe | Yes | Yes |

Fringe settings are primarily **minimum job** constraints, not persona-driven.

---

## 10. Persona & Budget Model

Budgets evolve:

- Phase 1–2: majority residential
- Phase 3: commercial ramps selectively

Commercial share can expand where:

- Job sizes justify travel
- HOA/PM work is repeatable
- Multi-unit projects produce economies of scale

Target conceptual mix: **~60% Residential / 40% Commercial**

---

## 11. Summary

Personas allow Cal Preserving to:

- Sell to two different classes of buyers
- Use shared surface and geo taxonomies
- Layer differentiation only when profitable
- Align language with stakeholder economics

Personas extend the system without fragmenting it prematurely.
