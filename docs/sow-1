Perfect — Option A locked.

That means the lifecycle in the SOW will read like:

“Phase 1–3 deployment constitutes system build and launch. Post-launch the Marketing Team maintains light optimization including negative refinement, minor bidding adjustments, RSA tuning, and budget reallocations as T&M support.”

No monthly commitments, no SLA, no performance guarantees — but also not a “hand-off and walk away.”

Before I generate:

Just confirm that this final small choice is correct:

Question: Does the Website Team deploy forms too?

Option A — Yes
Website Team is responsible for:
✔ Form markup
✔ Form validation
✔ Form > Salesforce webhook handoff
✔ Tracking scripts

Option B — No
Marketing Team embeds form via:
✔ Form provider embed
✔ iFrame
✔ Script widget
…and Website Team only hosts LP template

Option C — Hybrid
Website team owns markup + UI
Marketing team owns webhook logic

Which is reality for Cal Preserving?

Reply:

A, B, or C

Then I immediately generate both downloadable MDX files with zero additional questions.
