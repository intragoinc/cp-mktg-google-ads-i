## Section 1 – Furniture We Refinish

- Teak dining sets
- Teak loungers
- Hardwood benches

## Section 2 – Wood Species We Work With

Common hardwoods:

- Teak (most common)
- IPE
- Redwood (accent pieces)

These woods are durable, but weather quickly without maintenance.

## Section 3 – What Weather Does to Outdoor Furniture

Bay Area exposure causes:

- Graying and UV bleaching
- Surface oxidation
- Mildew and algae
- Rough/splintered surfaces
- Loss of natural oils

Refinishing restores natural color and protects the wood.
