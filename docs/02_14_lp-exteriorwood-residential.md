## Section 1 – Exterior Wood Takes a Beating in Bay Area Weather

Exterior wood structures are exposed to:

- UV sun exposure
- coastal moisture and fog
- winter rain
- pollen, dust and organic growth

Without maintenance, surfaces become:

- gray and weathered
- rough and splintered
- coated with mildew or algae
- dry and thirsty for protection

Seasonal maintenance extends life and preserves appearance.
