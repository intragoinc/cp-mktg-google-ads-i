# Part 5 — Statement of Work, Milestones, Timeline & Responsibilities

## 1. Project Objective

Deploy a segmented, geographically aware, service-specific Google Ads system for Cal Preserving that generates profitable booked revenue in the Bay Area exterior wood category, with expansion capability for commercial, HOA, and PM work.

The system must integrate with Salesforce and support attribution at the level of job size, close rate, seasonality, and minimum job constraints.

- UTM taxonomy implementation
- Salesforce attribution and field mapping
- Conversion tracking configuration
- Reporting structure definition
- Seasonality and commercial expansion playbooks

Excluded from Phase 1:
- Display
- YouTube
- Remarketing
- Broad match (optional Phase 3)
- Brand campaigns

## 6. Responsibility Assignment

RACI matrix for Phase 1:

Brent (Client Owner)
- Responsible: business strategy, budget, approvals
- Accountable: final call on spend and segmentation
- Consulted: messaging, positioning, job economics
- Informed: reporting and analytics

Aksha (Campaign & Technical)
- Responsible: build, configuration, tuning
- Accountable: platform correctness, performance
- Consulted: attribution and LP mapping
- Informed: Salesforce feedback

Ankush (Salesforce & Attribution)
- Responsible: UTM parse, field mapping, diagnostics
- Accountable: CRM integrity and attribution
- Consulted: job size, close rate, revenue fields
- Informed: performance trends

Cal Preserving (Client)
- Responsible: operational feedback, seasonality, minimums
- Consulted: estimator/crew routing and job fit
- Informed: results, optimization decisions

ChatGPT/Expert Layer
- Responsible: architecture, system design, technical plan
- Consulted: commercial strategy, taxonomy, attribution
- Informed: execution status

Google Ads Platform
- Informed: performance signals

Salesforce Platform
- Informed: attribution signals

## 7. Risk & Mitigation Considerations

Identified risks:

Low Intent Volume Risk:
- Mitigation: catch-all + commercial expansion + seasonality shifts

DIY/Low Ticket Noise:
- Mitigation: negative taxonomy + LP filtering + minimum logic

Fringe Routing Inefficiency:
- Mitigation: geo segmentation + commercial weighting + minimums

Commercial Attribution Ambiguity:
- Mitigation: buyer tagging + Phase 2 commercial breakout

Seasonality Whipsaw:
- Mitigation: furniture + pressure + HOA/PM inspection cycles

Estimator Load Saturation:
- Mitigation: performance-based throttling and minimum rules

---

## 8. Success Criteria

Success is defined by:

- Revenue per lead uplift
- Close rate uplift
- Job size uplift
- Job minimum compliance rate
- Geo mix shift (favoring Bay Area for residential)
- Buyer mix shift (favoring commercial in Fringe)
- Crew utilization smoothing
- Seasonality smoothing

Marketing metrics (CPL/CAC) are viewed as secondary to revenue metrics.

---

## 9. Handoff & Maintenance

After initial deployment:

Phase 2 cadence:
- weekly → bi-weekly → monthly adjustments

Optimization levers include:
- negatives
- budget routing
- surface/intent pruning
- commercial expansion
- seasonality levers
- bidding automation (later)

Phase 3 introduces revenue-informed automation for scaling.
