## **1. Overview Narrative (Short)**
Commercial inquiries come primarily from Property Managers (PM), HOAs, multi-unit complexes, and light commercial properties needing refinishing or repair of exterior wood surfaces such as decks, siding, exterior structures, and furniture. Demand is typically inbound and opportunistic rather than formal bid/RFP procurement. Jobs range from small one-off refinishing projects to multi-surface maintenance engagements, with portfolio-based repeat potential.

This persona values reliability, professionalism, compliance-lite, minimal disruption to tenants/residents, and predictable scheduling. While price matters, the total landed hassle and risk matters more than unit cost. Estimates are acceptable as a starting point; formal proposals are not mandatory in Phase-1.

---

## **2. Job To Be Done (JTBD)**
> “Help me maintain and restore the exterior wood assets on my properties with minimal disruption and maximum reliability.”

---

## **3. Core Motivations**
Primary:
- Maintain asset appearance & durability
- Reduce tenant/resident complaints
- Minimize safety/liability exposure
- Budget predictability
- Operational convenience

Secondary:
- Compliance with HOA rules
- Insurance considerations
- Seasonal maintenance scheduling
- Prevent larger future repairs (cost avoidance)

---

## **4. Pain Points**
- Tenant/resident complaints
- Asset degradation (rot, splintering, mildew)
- Safety issues (slippery decks, loose boards)
- Unreliable vendors
- Scheduling conflicts with crews/residents
- Need for proof of insurance/licensing
- Project updates & communication gaps

---

## **5. Buying Triggers / Events**
Event-Level Triggers:
- Resident complaint escalation
- Pre-winter damage
- Post-winter degradation
- Insurance inspection
- HOA board meetings
- Property refresh before leasing season

Seasonal Triggers:
- Q1 = furniture + repair peak (rain)
- Q2 = finishing peak (pre-summer)
- Q3 = turnover season for rentals
- Q4 = protective maintenance + budgeting

---

## **6. Evaluation Criteria (Ranked)**
1. Reliability & professionalism
2. Minimal operational disruption
3. Scope clarity (repair vs refinish)
4. Proof of insurance/licensing (compliance-lite)
5. Pricing & value
6. Scheduling flexibility
7. Quality & durability of refinishing
8. Communication & updates

---

## **7. Objections & Frictions**
- “I don’t want the vendor to bother residents.”
- “We need insurance and licensing on file.”
- “We need predictable scheduling windows.”
- “We can’t have slippery common areas.”
- “We need this done before leasing season.”
- “Who handles the furniture?”
- “Can you repair damaged boards too?”

---

## **8. Messaging DOs**
- Do emphasize reliability + professionalism
- Do state species expertise when relevant (Redwood, IPE, Teak)
- Do frame rain + UV protection benefits
- Do highlight safety risk reduction
- Do include multi-unit wording when appropriate
- Do use operational clarity (scope → schedule → crew)
- Do keep CTA friction low

---

## **9. Messaging DON'Ts**
- Don’t use RFP/RFQ/proposal language at this stage
- Don’t sell aesthetics as the only benefit
- Don’t anchor price in ads
- Don’t overuse homeowner language
- Don’t force heavy compliance documentation early

---

## **10. Value Wedges (Differentiation)**
- Reliability & communication
- Low-disruption execution
- Safety improvement
- Portfolio repeatability (multiple properties)
- Rainy-season work on furniture/exterior structures
- Repair + refinish under one vendor
- Bay Area species expertise (Redwood, IPE, Teak, Cedar)

---

## **11. CTA Preferences**
Best CTA (Phase-1):
> **Request a Free Estimate**

Acceptable Alternatives:
> Request Pricing  
> Request an Assessment  

Phase-2 CTA (future as budget scales):
> Request Proposal / Scope (not used now)

Avoid at Phase-1:
> Submit Bid  
> RFP Submission  
> Book Crew

---

## **12. Seasonal Notes**
Commercial seasonality differs from Residential:

- Q1 is powerful due to rainy-season furniture refinishing & repairs
- Q2-Q3 are property readiness windows (leasing, turnover)
- Q4 includes protective maintenance + budget cycles

Commercial is a strong hedge against seasonal volatility.

---

## **13. Price Sensitivity**
- Medium
- Lower sensitivity for safety-driven work
- Higher sensitivity for aesthetic-only projects
- Portfolio clients exhibit lower CAC over time

---

## **14. Disqualifiers / Estimator Filters**
Commercial disqualifiers include:
- Bid / RFP requirement at low job size (not worth it)
- Lack of scheduling access
- No decision authority present
- Replacement-level carpentry (refer out)
- Structural engineering needs (refer out)

Prioritize:
- Multi-surface projects
- Repeat opportunity properties
- PM-managed buildings
- Rain-compatible furniture refinishing

---

## **15. Notes for LP Writers**
LP Should:
- Emphasize reliability + safety + scheduling
- Mention lightweight compliance (insurance/licensing)
- Show multi-unit and portfolio scenarios
- Avoid homeowner-only imagery
- Keep CTA = estimate (not proposal phase yet)

LP Should Not:
- Focus exclusively on aesthetics
- Suggest RFP/RFQ processes at Phase-1
- Require project photos up-front (optional later)

---

## **16. Notes for RSA Writers**
RSA copy should:
- Convey reliability, safety, and durability
- Include species language when relevant
- Avoid consumer homeowner framing
- Use low-friction CTA (estimate)
- Mention multi-unit or common areas occasionally

Example messaging wedges:
- “Reduce tenant complaints & safety risks.”
- “Refinish & protect exterior wood assets.”
- “Reliable work for multi-unit properties.”

---

## **17. Notes for Estimators**
Commercial estimator posture:
- Operational clarity over aesthetics
- Scheduling often more important than price
- Multi-unit = upsell + repeat potential
- Furniture = rainy-season capacity filler
- Document compliance-lite expectations (insurance, W9, etc.)

---

## **18. Lead Journey Summary**
Typical Funnel:
Inquiry → Estimate → Approval → Crew → Resident Coordination → Final Sign-Off

Time Sensitivity:
Medium, event-driven (leasing cycles, complaints, storms)

---

## **19. Qualification Summary**
Commercial = Medium Volume / High Ticket / Medium CAC / High LTV

Most valuable aspect:
> **Portfolio & repeat jobs reduce effective CAC over time**
