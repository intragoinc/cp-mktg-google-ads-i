# **Purpose**
This document connects personas to tactical execution across the marketing → sales → delivery chain. It ensures persona-level decisions are reflected in:

- Google Ads (RSA + campaign structure)
- Landing Page design + routing
- Salesforce + attribution
- Estimator pipeline logic
- Seasonal scheduling
- Scaling strategy

---

# **1. Persona Overview Summary**
| Persona | Mode | CAC Model | LTV Model | Seasonality | Procurement |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Residential | High-volume | Medium | Low | High | Informal |
| Commercial | Medium-volume | Medium-High | High | Medium | Informal (Phase-1) |

Commercial is unified as inbound-light (not bid/RFP-driven) for current budget constraints.

---

# **2. Google Ads — RSA Implications**
### **Shared**
- CTA = **Request a Free Estimate**
- Species language allowed
- Benefit wedges differ by persona

### **Residential Messaging Wedges**
- Aesthetic transformation
- Outdoor enjoyment
- Curb appeal
- Longevity & protection
- Repair + safety (secondary)

### **Commercial Messaging Wedges**
- Reliability & scheduling
- Safety & liability reduction
- Low resident disruption
- Maintenance vs replacement economics
- Multi-surface efficiencies

### **Do NOT introduce yet**
- Proposal / Bid / RFP language
- Job minimum language (keep on LP)

---

# **3. Landing Page Implications**
Both personas convert via the same Phase-1 LP structure, but with different emphases in copy blocks.

### **Residential LP Emphasis**
- Before/after aesthetics
- Species expertise
- Outdoor lifestyle framing
- Maintenance frequency
- DIY vs pro benefits

### **Commercial LP Emphasis**
- Reliability & scheduling
- Safety/liability
- Insurance/licensing (compliance-lite)
- Reduced resident complaints
- Multi-unit examples
- Furniture = rainy-season filler

### **Future LP Expansion (Phase-2)**
- Commercial-specific LP
- PM/HOA-specific LP
- Furniture-specific rainy-season LP
- Siding-specific LP (higher ACV)

---

# **4. Salesforce & Attribution Implications**
Both personas should map cleanly into Salesforce via:

- Lead Source = Google Paid
- Sub Source = Search
- Campaign = Surface/Geo segmentation
- Persona Tag = Residential / Commercial
- Job Size Tags (optional Phase-2)
- Seasonal Trigger (optional Phase-2)

### **Matchback Notes**
Commercial has **higher matchback clarity** due to:

- formal approval processes
- traceable leases
- portfolio connections

---

# **5. Estimator Pipeline Implications**
Estimator should use persona context to:

### **Residential**
- Qualify job size
- Qualify surface type
- Explain repair vs refinish sequencing
- Upsell refinishing after repairs
- Smooth minimum objections

### **Commercial**
- Clarify scheduling + resident coordination
- Document compliance-lite needs (insurance, licensing)
- Identify portfolio or repeat potential
- Identify multi-surface upsell
- Propose rainy-season opportunities (furniture)

---

# **6. Seasonal Scheduling Implications**
Personas support anti-seasonality strategy:

### **Residential**
Peak: Q2–Q3 (refinishing)
Off-peak: Q1 (repair) + Q4 (protective)

### **Commercial**
Peak: Q1 (furniture) + Q2 (property readiness)
Off-peak: Q3 (turnovers) + Q4 (maintenance)

Rainy-season furniture refinishing is a key hedge.

---

# **7. Pricing & CAC Implications**
Residential:
- CAC → single job
- Price sensitivity → medium-high
- LTV → low unless multi-surface
- Referral path → neighbors

Commercial:
- CAC → amortized via portfolios
- Price sensitivity → medium
- LTV → medium-high
- Referral path → property networks

---

# **8. Scaling Triggers (Future Phase)**
Commercial persona should split only when ≥ **$10K/mo** + matchback data confirms.

Future splits:
- PM vs HOA vs Multi-Unit
- Proposal CTA
- Portfolio routing
- Dedicated LP
- Seasonal campaigns

Residential LP remains unified unless:
- Siding reaches sufficient volume
- Furniture becomes permanent campaign

---

# **9. Data Signals to Monitor**
Signals to watch for future splits:

- Higher CVR for commercial
- Higher ACV for commercial
- Lower dropout for commercial
- Portfolio or repeat activity
- Rain-season revenue lift
- Lead source → job site multiplicity
- Seasonal clusters
- Species-specific demand
- Surface-specific demand

---

# **10. Disqualifiers & Filters**
Handled downstream, not in ads:

**Residential Filters**
- Job size minimum
- Access/scheduling
- Replacement vs refinish
- Decision authority

**Commercial Filters**
- Bid-only procurement (disqualify early at low ACV)
- Heavy compliance demands (Phase-3 only)
- Structural engineering requirements
- Access coordination constraints

---

# **11. Phase-2 Enhancements**
When budget scales, unlock:

✔ Proposal CTA  
✔ Bid workflow  
✔ Commercial LP  
✔ Siding LP  
✔ Furniture LP  
✔ Retarget loops  
✔ Post-job review automation  
✔ Portfolio nurture cadence  
✔ Job size scoring model  
✔ Rain-season promo  
✔ Multi-site pricing

---

# **12. Phase-3 Enhancements**
When matchback + CAC/LTV validated:

✔ Persona-split campaigns  
✔ Estimator specialization  
✔ Capacity-based bidding  
✔ Predictive crew scheduling  
✔ Rainy-season contracting  
✔ PM/HOA outbound playbook  
✔ Multi-property annual contracts

---

# **13. Quick Executive Summary**
Residential = volume engine  
Commercial = LTV engine  
Furniture = rainy-season hedge  
Siding = premium ACV  
Portfolio = CAC reducer  
Matchback = scaling unlock
