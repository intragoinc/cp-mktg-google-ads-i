# Part 6 — Optimization, Scaling & Long-Term Strategy

## 1. Purpose of the Optimization Layer

Once campaigns are live and attribution is validated, the focus shifts from correctness to performance. The optimization layer tunes the system to produce:

- higher job value
- higher close rates
- better service mix
- healthier buyer mix
- minimized routing waste
- minimized estimator waste
- stable crew utilization across seasons

Google Ads can deliver volume, but optimization decides whether that volume converts into profitable work inside Cal Preserving’s operational constraints.

---

## 2. Optimization Framework

Phase 1 optimization focuses on:

- negative reinforcement
- keyword pruning
- budget routing by service/geo
- landing page iteration
- RSA tuning
- minimum compliance
- basic buyer mix analysis
- basic seasonality adjustments

Phase 2 introduces revenue-informed optimization using Salesforce match-back data:

- revenue per lead
- revenue per opportunity
- revenue per campaign
- revenue per service
- revenue per geo
- close rate by geo
- close rate by buyer
- close rate by surface

Phase 3 adds automation and scaling.

---

## 3. Optimization Inputs

Optimization decisions require three categories of inputs:

Demand-Side Inputs:
- impression volume
- CTR performance
- query quality
- search term expansion
- competitor movements

Supply-Side Inputs:
- estimator bandwidth
- crew availability
- routing feasibility
- season/weather constraints
- minimum compliance

Revenue Inputs:
- job size
- margin
- close rate
- buyer mix
- repeat/maintenance demand

Cal Preserving must optimize on all three, not just demand metrics.

---

## 4. Negative Reinforcement Strategy

Negative keywords are the most immediate lever for quality control.

Reinforcement timeline:

Week 1–2:
- block DIY/tutorial/materials leakage
- block composite/brand leakage
- block “cheap/discount” leakage

Week 3–6:
- block fringe low-ticket surfaces
- block construction/contractor bleed
- block handyman overlap

Week 6–12:
- trim search term bleed from catch-all
- block seasonal noise

Negatives must be added systematically at:
- account level
- campaign level
- ad group level

---

## 5. Keyword & Intent Pruning

Pruning removes low-yield clusters, keeping the system efficient and reducing estimator load.

Pruning logic:

Remove low-yield keywords when:
- CTR low
- Impression high
- Spend > threshold
- No conversions
- No form submissions
- No Salesforce jobs
- Poor minimum compliance

Protect profitable clusters even if volume low.

---

## 6. Budget Reallocation Logic

Phase 1 allocations are fixed for testing.

After data maturity, shift budget toward:

- services with higher revenue per lead
- geos with higher close rates and minimum compliance
- surfaces producing commercial/HOA demand

Likely winners:
- Deck Bay Area
- Siding Bay Area
- Siding Fringe (commercial-leaning)
- Commercial/HOA Bay Area

Likely capped:
- Pressure Bay Area
- Catch-all Bay Area
- Catch-all Fringe

Fence/Furniture/Exterior remains exploratory until demand validated.

---

## 7. Buyer Mix Shaping

Buyer shaping shifts demand toward commercial/HOA/PM cohorts.

Phase 1:
- mixed buyers
- no breakout

Phase 2:
- breakout ad groups for commercial with tailored messaging:
  - licensing
  - insurance
  - experience
  - risk mitigation
  - property value
  - inspection cycles
  - portfolio work

Phase 3:
- commercial-only campaigns with revenue bidding

Commercial cohorts exhibit:
- higher ticket size
- repeat work
- portfolio scheduling
- less seasonality
- lower minimum sensitivity

---

## 8. Seasonality Management

Seasonality levers smooth estimator and crew utilization.

Peak (Dry months):
- emphasize Deck and Siding
- push residential volume
- maximize Bay Area routing

Rain months:
- push Furniture and Pressure
- shift to commercial/HOA
- use inspection cycles
- promote maintenance vs restoration

Pressure and furniture become “rain-viable” lead magnets.

---

## 9. Minimum Enforcement & Routing Economics

Minimum job enforcement reduces estimator churn and dead leads.

Logic:

Bay Area:
- minimum moderate
- LP filter
- estimator screen if required

Fringe:
- minimum higher
- LP filter stricter
- commercial weighting higher

Minimum compliance measurement:
- Met vs Failed ratio
- by Geo
- by Service
- by Buyer
- by Season

Routing economics matter more in Fringe.

---

## 10. Revenue-Based Optimization

Phase 2 introduces revenue metrics into optimization:

Revenue per Lead (RPL)
Revenue per Opportunity (RPO)
Revenue per Close (RPC)
Revenue per Campaign (RPCa)
Revenue per Geo (RPCg)

These metrics allow intelligent scaling:

- scale services with higher RPC
- scale geos with higher RPCg
- reduce low-RPC geos/services

---

## 11. Automation Strategy

Automation is introduced only after revenue signals validated.

Phase 1:
- manual bidding

Phase 2:
- enhanced CPC / max conversions
- cautious smart bidding tests

Phase 3:
- target ROAS on commercial cohorts only

Commercial cohorts support ROAS bidding because:
- higher job value
- predictable close rate
- less seasonality variance
- lower estimator choke points

Residential cohorts remain manual or max conversions.

---

## 12. Commercial Expansion Strategy

Commercial expansion follows a three-step path:

Step 1: Identify commercial signals in search terms:
queries with:
- commercial
- multi-unit
- apartment
- HOA
- PM
- property management
- facilities

Step 2: Break out commercial ad groups
with:
- tailored messaging
- tailored negatives
- tailored LP

Step 3: Break out commercial campaigns
with:
- revenue bidding
- city overlays
- scaling budgets

Commercial remains a key strategic revenue vector.

---

## 13. Optimization Cadence

Cadence recommended:

Early Phase:
- weekly adjustments (Weeks 1–6)

Mid Phase:
- bi-weekly adjustments (Weeks 6–12)

Mature Phase:
- monthly assessments (Months 3+)

Commercial Phase:
- quarterly planning

---

## 14. Reporting & Learning Loops

Feedback loops feed optimization from:

Salesforce:
- close rate
- job size
- revenue
- buyer type
- minimum compliance
- seasonality

Google:
- query data
- CPC trends
- competitive data
- impression share

Field Operations:
- estimator load
- crew utilization
- routing constraints

Optimization involves all three.

---

## 15. Long-Term Scaling Plan

Long-term scaling does not simply “raise budgets.” Scaling occurs by:

- shifting buyer mix toward commercial/HOA
- shifting geo mix
- improving RPCg
- reducing routing waste
- strengthening minimum compliance
- optimizing seasonality
- introducing ROAS automation
- expanding surfaces and species
- expanding cities
- expanding LP portfolio

This creates a durable, defensible paid demand channel.

## 16. Outcome of Part 6

Part 6 defines how Cal Preserving will move from correctness to profitability to scalability. It treats paid demand as a strategic growth tool that coordinates:

- marketing
- sales
- operations
- routing
- seasonality
- revenue

Parts 1–6 together form a complete system for profitable paid search execution in Cal Preserving’s category.
