# Cal Preserving Google Ads Initiative  
## Part 1 – Executive & Context Layer

<TableOfContents />

## 1. Overview

Cal Preserving is undertaking a structured Google Ads initiative to profitably grow its book of business across the Bay Area, with a focus on:

- High-value **deck** and **wood siding** refinishing and preservation
- Selective growth in **fence**, **furniture**, and **exterior wood structures**
- Thoughtful use of **pressure washing** as a supporting / lead-magnet service
- Gradual, disciplined expansion into **commercial / HOA / property manager** work

This document (Part 1 – Executive & Context Layer) defines the **why**, **what**, and **business outcomes** for the project. Later parts of the dossier (Parts 2–6) drill into segmentation, campaign architecture, tracking, operations, and optimization.

## 2. Executive Summary

Cal Preserving operates in a high-value but operationally complex niche: **exterior wood preservation** in the Bay Area. Jobs are often high ticket, but:

- Travel time and crew routing make **geography** matter a lot.
- Species and surfaces (redwood, cedar, IPE, teak, hardwood umbrellas) change both **pricing** and **buyer intent**.
- **Residential** buyers behave very differently from **HOA / property managers**.
- Seasonality (rain vs sun) affects **which services are sellable when**, especially furniture and pressure washing.

Historically, demand has come through a mix of organic visibility, reputation, and offline referrals. The goal of this initiative is not “just more leads”, but:

> **More of the *right* leads, in the *right* locations, for the *right* services, at the *right* job size – at a sustainable acquisition cost.**

To do that, Cal Preserving will:

1. Build a **segmented Google Ads structure** based on:
   - Service category (deck, siding, fence/furniture/exterior wood, pressure, catch-all)
   - Geography (**Bay Area vs Fringe**)
   - Buyer type (mixed Residential + Commercial in phase 1, with commercial breakouts later)

2. Use **dedicated landing pages** for the key services:
   - Deck
   - Siding
   - Fence / Exterior Wood Structures
   - Furniture (teak / IPE sets)
   - Pressure washing
   - Catch-all “Bay Area Exterior Wood” page

3. Start with **phrase + exact match** and strong **negative keyword** control to:
   - Block retail/product searches
   - Block composite brands where appropriate
   - Filter out DIY, “how to”, cheap materials, and off-target intents

4. Implement **Salesforce + UTM + attribution** so that:
   - Each lead is tagged by service, geography, and campaign concept
   - Results can be matched back to **job size, close rate, and margin**
   - Future optimization is based on business outcomes, not only click metrics

5. Roll out over **8–12 weeks for core implementation**, then continue optimization for the rest of the year.

The outcome: a **campaign system**, not a one-off campaign — something that can be maintained, tuned, and scaled rather than rebuilt every season.

## 3. Strategic Objectives

The Google Ads initiative is designed to support several layered objectives:

### 3.1 Business Objectives

- **Increase high-value booked jobs** (decks and siding first, plus selective commercial/HOA work).
- **Protect minimum job size** economics, especially in Fringe territories.
- **Grow commercial revenue mix** over time (targeting ~40% Commercial vs 60% Residential as a guiding weighting).
- **Stabilize demand seasonally** by:
  - Using **furniture** and “rain-safe” work to keep crews productive in wet months.
  - Emphasizing deck/siding during peak seasons.

### 3.2 Marketing Objectives

- Establish a **repeatable paid demand channel** that:
  - Supplements organic search and referrals.
  - Reaches buyers at the right moment (maintenance, renewal, repaint/refinish cycles).
- Build **service-specific landing experiences** that:
  - Speak to the needs of deck vs siding vs furniture vs fence vs exterior structures.
  - Make it easy for prospects to understand what Cal Preserving actually does.
- Improve **lead quality** by:
  - Targeting relevant species and surfaces.
  - Avoiding the “cheap handyman” or “DIY” cohort where possible.

### 3.3 Operational Objectives

- Support **estimator efficiency** by routing more of the “right” kind of jobs:
  - Jobs in the **Bay Area** core, where travel and routing are favorable.
  - Jobs above minimum thresholds, especially in **Fringe** geos.
- Reduce time lost to:
  - Low-quality leads in far-flung geos.
  - Jobs that can never meet minimums.
- Provide a structure that works with:
  - Existing Salesforce process.
  - Crew routing and estimator workload realities.

## 4. Expected Outcomes by Phase

The project is designed in **phases** so that Cal Preserving can go live quickly with a high-quality initial structure, then deepen and refine over time.

### Phase 1 – Core Launch (Weeks 1–8/12)

- Live campaigns for:
  - **Deck – Bay Area / Fringe**
  - **Siding – Bay Area / Fringe**
  - **Fence/Furniture/Exterior Wood – Bay Area (combined)**  
  - **Pressure – Bay Area**
  - **Catch-all – Bay Area/Fringe**
- Landing pages in place for:
  - Deck
  - Siding
  - Fence/Exterior Wood Structures
  - Furniture (teak / IPE / redwood sets)
  - Pressure washing
  - Catch-all “Bay Area Exterior Wood”
- Phrase + Exact match keywords launched with:
  - Intent-driven clustering (refinishing / restoration / staining / painting etc.)
  - Strong negative keyword sets to block DIY/product/retail searches.
- Initial budget allocation aligned to weighting (example guidance, subject to tuning):
  - **Deck:** higher share in Bay Area.
  - **Siding:** strong share; often yields larger, higher-value jobs.
  - **Fence/Furniture/Exteriors:** moderate share, with guardrails on lead quality.
  - **Pressure:** careful spend; used as supportive / lead-magnet while respecting job minimums.
  - **Catch-All:** capped but present for discovery and long-tail.

**Phase 1 Outcome:**  
A working, segmented Google Ads system that is aligned to Cal Preserving’s core services and geography, producing an initial stream of leads that can be monitored in Salesforce and tuned based on real close-rate and job size data.

---

### Phase 2 – Refinement & Attribution (Months 3–6)

- Tighten performance based on:
  - Lead quality feedback from sales.
  - Job size, close-rate, and margin data from Salesforce.
- Improve **negative keyword strategy** to:
  - Remove recurring bad lead patterns.
  - Block out irrelevant species/intents that slip through.
- Establish **clear reporting views**:
  - Leads and opps by service (Deck, Siding, Fence/Furn/Ext, Pressure, Catch-all).
  - By geo (Bay Area vs Fringe).
  - By buyer type (Residential vs emerging Commercial/HOA/PM).
- Begin:
  - **Commercial / HOA / PM ad group breakouts** (usage of “commercial”, “HOA”, “property management” keywords, etc., with tailored negatives and messaging).
  - Tuning of budgets to favor:
    - Better-margin services.
    - Better-performing geos.
    - Service/geo combinations that reliably produce larger, repeatable work.

**Phase 2 Outcome:**  
A more efficient, **measurably profitable** Google Ads system where spend flows towards combinations of service + geography + buyer type that actually produce good jobs, not just form fills.

---

### Phase 3 – Commercial / HOA / PM Expansion (Months 6–12)

- Add or expand **commercial-focused ad groups** and possibly campaigns:
  - Messaging that speaks to:
    - Multi-unit properties.
    - Boards and property managers.
    - Risk mitigation, licensing, insurance, and workmanship guarantees.
  - Negative keyword sets that keep out consumer “cheap handyman” traffic while still supporting relevant commercial queries.
- Adjust Bay Area vs Fringe strategy:
  - More commercial emphasis in Fringe regions where travel can be justified by larger jobs.
  - Stricter minimums and filtering for small residential work in Fringe.
- Develop **playbooks** for:
  - Seasonal allocation (e.g., heavy deck/siding in prime season; furniture and certain structures when weather reduces outdoor refinishing throughput).
  - Budget scaling in months where crews have capacity to absorb more work.

**Phase 3 Outcome:**  
A system that doesn’t just “run Google Ads” but **supports strategic business growth** — especially by increasing high-quality commercial and HOA/PM work with the right risk/reward profile.

## 5. Market & Buyer Context

Cal Preserving operates in a region where:

- Exterior wood is both:
  - Aesthetic and lifestyle-driven (decks, furniture, architectural details).
  - A material asset that must be maintained to protect home or property value.
- Many properties have **both decks and siding**, or wood used in multiple applications.
- Composite and non-wood systems (e.g., Trex, cement siding) exist, but:
  - There is still a substantial installed base of real wood that needs care.
  - Many buyers prefer real wood when maintained properly.

### 5.1 Residential Buyers

Residential customers typically:

- Start their search around:
  - Visible degradation (graying, peeling, cupping, mold, mildew).
  - Project milestones (before selling, after buying, pre-summer, post-storm, etc.).
- Care about:
  - Trust, past work, reviews.
  - Whether the contractor is “real” and insured.
  - Price, but not only price — especially on higher-end homes.
- Often **do not know the exact species** (hence the “hardwood umbrella” use case on decks, but not on siding/exteriors where species identification is more common).

The Google Ads strategy must:

- Capture “I know what I have” searchers (e.g., “redwood deck refinishing Bay Area”).
- Capture “I just want this fixed” general searches (e.g., “deck refinishing near me”).
- Filter out “do it yourself”, “materials only”, and similar noise via negative keywords.

### 5.2 Commercial / HOA / Property Managers

Commercial and HOA/PM buyers:

- Often **do not use “near me” language**:
  - More likely to use “Bay Area”, city names, or “commercial” descriptors.
- Care strongly about:
  - Licensing, insurance, OSHA alignment, professionalism.
  - Reliability, scheduling, communication, and documentation.
  - Minimizing risk of contractor failures or liability events.
- Are less sensitive to $600 minimums and more sensitive to:
  - Quality.
  - Project management.
  - Disruption minimization.

The campaign structure must reflect this by:

- Using **mixed campaigns initially**, then introducing commercial-focused ad groups and later campaigns as data accumulates.
- Ensuring the **negative strategy** for commercial/HOA ad groups:
  - Keeps them from filling with low-value residential traffic or DIY clicks.

---

## 6. Geographic & Routing Context

The Bay Area is large and traffic-intensive. For Cal Preserving:

- The **Bay Area core** (primary service area) should receive:
  - Higher budget allocations.
  - More service variety (including smaller but profitable jobs).
- **Fringe territories** (outlying areas) should:
  - Have a **higher minimum job amount** to justify travel.
  - Focus more strongly on:
    - Larger deck/siding jobs.
    - Commercial/HOA opportunities where one trip can cover a large project.
  - Avoid being flooded with low-ticket residential leads that can’t meet minimums.

The Google Ads campaign design reflects this by:

- Differentiating **Bay Area vs Fringe** campaign/campaign-groupings.
- Applying **different minimums and filters** in Fringe.
- Using the same core keyword strategy, but:
  - With fewer low-volume “nice to have” ad groups in Fringe.
  - With emphasis on job types more likely to be worth the drive.

## 7. Framing the Opportunity

The opportunity for Cal Preserving is not simply “more leads” from Google Ads. It is:

1. **A structured, defendable demand generation system**  
   that can:
   - Be tuned and improved each quarter,
   - Survive changes in Google’s ad products,
   - Align with Salesforce and real business KPIs.

2. **A way to selectively grow commercial and HOA/PM work**  
   by:
   - Targeting the right geographies and queries.
   - Speaking directly to property manager / board concerns.
   - Building a track record of profitable, large-ticket projects.

3. **A buffer against seasonality and demand shocks**  
   using:
   - Furniture and other “rain-tolerant” services when decks/siding slow down.
   - Thoughtful budget allocation by month and service.

4. **A framework for future automation and AI-assistance**  
   because:
   - The structure will be explicit, documented, and tied to data.
   - Future tools (AI assistants, automation platforms, reporting layers) can plug into a clearly defined taxonomy.

---

## 8. Success Criteria (High Level)

At the executive level, the initiative will be considered successful if:

- The **cost per qualified lead (CPL)** and **cost per acquired customer (CAC)** for key services are within acceptable thresholds relative to:
  - Average job size.
  - Close rate.
  - Margins by service and geo.
- The **mix of job types and geos** coming from paid channels:
  - Skews toward larger, better-margin work.
  - Does **not** overload estimators and crews with low-fit, low-ticket jobs in distant areas.
- Cal Preserving has:
  - A clear, documented understanding of what is working and why.
  - The ability to scale or contract specific campaigns intentionally.
  - A roadmap for expanding commercial/HOA work, not just taking whatever comes.

Later parts of this dossier (Parts 2–6) will convert this executive framing into:

- A detailed **segmentation & taxonomy model** (Part 2).
- A concrete **campaign and ad group architecture** (Part 3).
- A robust **tracking, Salesforce, and attribution plan** (Part 4).
- A clear **execution and SOW-style plan** (Part 5).
- A long-term **optimization and scaling strategy** (Part 6).

Part 1 provides the anchor: the business logic and outcomes that the whole system is designed to support.
