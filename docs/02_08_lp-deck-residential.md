## Section 1 – Problems We Solve

Your deck is exposed to Bay Area sun, fog, rain and coastal moisture year-round. Over time you see:

- Graying, faded boards
- Mildew and algae buildup
- Splintering or rough surfaces
- Uneven color from past DIY staining
- Water no longer beading on the surface

Ignoring these issues shortens the life of the deck and makes it less enjoyable to use.

## Section 6 – FAQs (Residential Decks)

**How often should my deck be refinished?**  
Most Bay Area decks need maintenance every 2–4 years depending on sun exposure, wood species and previous coatings.

**Can you work around furniture and planters?**  
Yes. We’ll ask you to move what you can; we’ll help with the rest as part of the prep plan agreed in the estimate.

**Do you repair structural damage?**  
We can handle minor repairs. Larger structural issues will be noted and may require a carpenter or contractor.

**What products do you use?**  
We select high-quality stains and sealers tested for Bay Area conditions and matched to your wood species.
