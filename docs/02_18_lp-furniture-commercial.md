## Section 3 – Wood Species We Work With

Common hardwoods in commercial settings:

- **Teak** – Most common in hospitality and pool areas
- **IPE** – Used in high-traffic outdoor furniture
- **Redwood** – Accent pieces and benches

These woods are durable, but weather quickly without maintenance—especially in high-use environments.

## Section 4 – What Weather & Use Do to Outdoor Furniture

Bay Area exposure combined with heavy use causes:

- Graying and UV bleaching
- Surface oxidation and discoloration
- Mildew and algae buildup
- Rough, splintered surfaces (liability concern)
- Loss of natural oils and protective finish

Refinishing restores appearance, removes hazards and extends furniture life.
