# Part 1.4 — Geography Model

---

## 1. Overview

Geography impacts Cal Preserving’s unit economics due to:

- Travel time
- Crew routing
- Estimator workload
- Minimum job viability
- Commercial vs Residential distribution

The initiative uses a structured geo model aligned to campaign phases.

---

## 2. Geo Segments

Two geo segments are defined:

1. **Bay Area (Core)**
2. **Fringe (Outlying)**

These are logical service areas rather than formal ZIP mappings. ZIP codification is added operationally during Salesforce integration and not required for Phase 1.

---

## 3. Geo Definitions (Conceptual)

| Geo | Profile | Strategic Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Bay Area (Core)** | Dense housing, many wood surfaces, high deck/siding penetration | Highest efficiency & demand |
| **Fringe (Outlying)** | Lower density, more travel, fewer small residential jobs | Higher minimums, better for commercial |

---

## 4. Geo Economics

### 4.1 Bay Area Core

Bay Area is favorable for:

- Smaller residential jobs
- Repeat work
- High-referral density
- Multi-surface opportunities

### 4.2 Fringe Territories

Fringe is favorable for:

- Larger deck & siding jobs
- Commercial / HOA / PM work
- Jobs with ticket size that justifies travel

Fringe is **not favorable** for:

- Small residential furniture
- Small pressure-only
- Low-ticket fence-only

---

## 5. Geo Usage by Phase

| Phase | Bay Area | Fringe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | ✅ Enabled | ❌ Disabled | Launch simplicity |
| **2** | ✅ Enabled | ✅ Enabled | Residential only |
| **3** | ✅ Enabled | ✅ Enabled | Residential + Commercial split |

---

## 6. Implications on Campaign Architecture

**Bay Area** supports full campaign spread:

- Deck
- Siding
- Structures
- Furniture
- Pressure
- Catch-all

**Fringe** will run more constrained:

- Deck (strong)
- Siding (strong)
- Structures (moderate)
- Furniture (selective)
- Pressure (selective)
- Catch-all (limited)

Budget weighting and minimums differ, but are operational and not implemented in ad copy.

---

## 7. Search Language Differences

| Geo | Search Language |
|---|---|
| Bay Area | “Near me”, city names, consumer queries |
| Fringe | City names, regional identifiers (e.g. counties) |

Commercial persona increases the use of:

- “Bay Area” phrasing
- Property-type phrasing (HOA, apartments, facilities)

---

## 8. Geo & Persona Interaction

Personas and geos interact meaningfully only in **Phase 3**:

| Geo × Persona | Notes |
|---|---|
| Bay Area × Residential | Core volume |
| Bay Area × Commercial | Moderate — high value |
| Fringe × Residential | Selective — minimums matter |
| Fringe × Commercial | Attractive — larger ticket sizes |

---

## 9. Geo in Salesforce

Geo does **not** appear inside the landing page. It is inferred from:

- UTM parameters (campaign)
- Salesforce routing
- ZIP data captured in the form

This avoids user friction and aligns with routing systems.

---

## 10. Summary

The geo model enables:

- Efficient estimator allocation
- Higher close-rate targeting
- Lower wasted travel
- Commercial growth in Fringe locations

Geography is therefore a silent but foundational dimension of the overall initiative.
