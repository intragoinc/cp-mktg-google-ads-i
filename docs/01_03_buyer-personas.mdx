# Part 1.3 — Buyer Personas

---

> **Note:** Persona usage does not apply until **Phase 3**.  
Phases 1–2 operate Residential-only without persona splits.  
Personas are documented here for completeness and future alignment.

---

## 1. Persona Overview

Two primary buyer personas are defined for the initiative:

1. **Residential**
2. **Commercial / HOA / Property Management**

These do not imply different campaigns until **Phase 3**, but inform future landing pages, messaging, SOW structure, and negative keywords.

---

## 2. Residential Persona

**Surface types:**  
Deck, siding, fence, furniture, exterior structures, pressure washing, catch-all.

**Decision triggers:**
- Gray/aged wood
- Peeling or UV damage
- Mold/mildew
- “We’re hosting”
- “We’re selling”
- Post-purchase improvements
- Seasonal refresh

**Key concerns:**
- Trust & workmanship
- Reviews & reputation
- Price fit vs quality
- Scheduling & disruption
- Care instructions

**Knowledge patterns:**
- Low → medium surface knowledge
- Species often unknown (“is this cedar?”)
- Species umbrella on decks is acceptable

**Search behavior:**
- Uses “near me”
- Uses city names
- Mix of surface + outcome language

**Seasonality:**
- High — especially deck & siding

**Economic sensitivity:**
- Moderate → wide spread
- Small + midsize residential jobs dominate in count

---

## 3. Commercial / HOA / PM Persona

**Surface types:**
Same surfaces as Residential, with higher concentration in:
- Multi-unit decks
- Multi-building siding
- Fences / exterior envelopes
- Teak/IPE furniture clusters (pools, resorts)

**Decision triggers:**
- Scheduled maintenance cycles
- Board approvals
- Safety / liability
- Weathering complaints
- Aesthetic standards
- Reserve budgets

**Key concerns:**
- Licensing & insurance
- Risk mitigation
- Reliability & documentation
- Scope accuracy & approvals
- Crew professionalism
- Job disruption minimization

**Knowledge patterns:**
- Medium → high surface knowledge
- Species identification more typical
- Less umbrella usage (except hardwood category support)

**Search behavior:**
- Rarely uses “near me”
- Uses “Bay Area” or city clusters
- Uses property-type language:
  - HOA, condominium, multi-unit, complex, resort, facilities
  - Property management / asset management
- Uses proposal language instead of estimate language

**Seasonality:**
- Lower — scheduling is bureaucratic rather than lifestyle-driven

**Economic sensitivity:**
- Lower — project size drives economics
- Larger average job size
- Repeatable cycles possible

## 4. Implications for the Initiative

| Dimension | Residential | Commercial |
|---|---|---|
| CTA | “Request a Free Estimate” | “Request a Proposal” |
| Landing Pages | Consumer tone | Professional tone |
| Seasonality | High | Low |
| Routing | Estimator | Estimator |
| Knowledge | Low → Medium | Medium → High |
| Messaging | Aesthetic + value | Risk + compliance |
| Geo leverage | Bay Area heavy | Bay Area + Fringe valuable |
| Job Size | Small → Large | Medium → Very Large |

---

## 5. Phase Mapping

| Phase | Personas Live? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | ❌ | Residential only (implicit) |
| Phase 2 | ❌ | Residential only + Fringe |
| Phase 3 | ✅ | Residential + Commercial split |

---

## 6. Summary

Personas are not used for launch. They become meaningful when:

- Landing pages fork (surface × persona)
- CTAs fork (estimate vs proposal)
- Messaging forks (consumer vs professional)
- Campaigns fork at a persona level

This will occur in **Phase 3**, enabling commercial growth with proper economics and search behavior alignment.
