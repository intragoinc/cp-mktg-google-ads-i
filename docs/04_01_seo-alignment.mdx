# 04_01 — SEO Alignment Spec

> Canonical alignment between Paid Search (Google Ads), Landing Pages, and future SEO redesign.

---

## 1. Scope

This document defines how Cal Preserving:

- Uses landing pages for **paid acquisition**
- Maintains future SEO viability
- Avoids duplicate content and cannibalization
- Establishes canonical URL patterns for Phase 1–3 rollout

This document does **not** define:

- Website navigation
- Full SEO redesign / IA (“Information Architecture”)
- Content calendar
- Technical SEO implementation details (handled in 04_03)

---

## 2. Strategic Context

Cal Preserving operates paid search through a **surface-based segmentation model** with optional persona differentiation:

| Dimension | Values |
|---|---|
| Persona | Residential, Commercial |
| Surface | Deck, Siding, Wood-Structures, Pressure, Catch-All |
| Geo (Campaign Only) | Bay Area, Fringe |

The LP system must:

- Match **keyword → surface → LP**
- Allow persona-specific messaging
- Maintain Phase stability
- Avoid polluting the main SEO stack prematurely

---

## 3. Alignment Principles

1. **Surface governs LP intent**  
   e.g., “deck refinishing” → deck LP

2. **Persona governs messaging**  
   e.g., Residential vs Commercial tone & CTA

3. **Geo remains campaign-only**  
   Not in URL, title, or navigation structure

4. **SEO stack must remain future-scalable**  
   Avoid premature persona split in main navigation

5. **Avoid duplicate surface content** across personas & geo

---

## 4. Canonical URL Structure (Phase 3 Model)

URLs are persona-first, surface-second:

```
/{persona}/{surface}/
```

With this canonical table:

| Persona | Surface | URL |
|---|---|---|
| Residential | Deck | `/residential/deck/` |
| Residential | Siding | `/residential/siding/` |
| Residential | Wood Structures | `/residential/wood-structures/` |
| Residential | Pressure | `/residential/pressure/` |
| Residential | Catch-All | `/residential/` |
| Commercial | Deck | `/commercial/deck/` |
| Commercial | Siding | `/commercial/siding/` |
| Commercial | Wood Structures | `/commercial/wood-structures/` |
| Commercial | Pressure | `/commercial/pressure/` |
| Commercial | Catch-All | `/commercial/` |

---

## 5. Indexing & SEO Policy

**Paid LP pages will be `noindex, follow`**

Rationale:

- Prevent SEO cannibalization
- Avoid duplicate content across persona
- Future-proof for SEO redesign
- Allow link equity flow for internal links

Canonical implementation directive:

```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex,follow">
<link rel="canonical" href="https://calpreserving.com/">
```

Where canonical target = nearest SEO-viable surface or root.

---

## 6. Canonical SEO Surface Pages (Not Persona-Split)

Future SEO stack consolidates to:

```
/deck/
/siding/
/wood-structures/
/pressure-washing/
/exterior-wood/     (Catch-all)
```

These align to keyword demand without persona explosion.

Paid LPs exist **outside** SEO stack.

---

## 7. CTA Divergence (Persona Based)

| Persona | CTA Copy |
|---|---|
| Residential | **Request a Free Estimate** |
| Commercial | **Request a Proposal** |

Both drive to the **same system-form** for now.

---

## 8. Content Variants (Messaging)

Paid LP copy must diverge here:

| Dimension | Residential | Commercial |
|---|---|---|
| Trust signals | Quality, Reviews, Craft | Insurance, OSHA, Documentation |
| Work framing | Aesthetic + Longevity | Scope + Risk + Disruption |
| Economic logic | Protect value + Enjoyment | Protect Asset + Reduce Risk |
| Photos | Lifestyle + Detail | Multi-unit + Scale |
| Testimonials | Homeowners | PM / Board / Multi-unit |
| CTA | Estimate | Proposal |

---

## 9. Internal Linking Rules

Paid LPs may link to:

✔ Gallery  
✔ FAQ  
✔ Process  
✔ Home  
✔ SEO pages (optional future)

Paid LPs must not:

✖ Introduce persona goblins in SEO structure  
✖ Compete with SEO pages for intent  
✖ Generate duplicate surface landing content for SEO

Paid LP may optionally inject:

- Related surfaces
- Before/after gallery
- Review badges
- Case studies

---

## 10. Redirect & Duplicate Control

To avoid SEO pollution:

**Rule:** Multiple query entry points → same LP → same canonical

Example:

```
/residential/deck/
?utm_source=google
?utm_campaign=deck-bayarea
?gclid=xxxx
```

All resolve to same canonical.

No redirects applied at this layer.

---

## 11. Phase Compatibility

### Phase 1 (Residential Only)

URLs used:

```
/residential/deck/
```

### Phase 2 (Add Fringe via Campaign)

Same URLs:

```
/residential/deck/
```

### Phase 3 (Persona Split)

Commercial URLs added:

```
/commercial/deck/
```

---

## 12. SEO vs Paid Sitemaps

To avoid index conflict:

**Paid Sitemap:**

- Not submitted to Google
- Not in robots.txt
- Generated for QA / Campaign LP reference only

**SEO Sitemap:**

- Submitted to Google
- Includes canonical SEO pages only

---

## 13. Future SEO Playbook Dependencies

To evolve SEO later, add:

- Species pages (optional)
- Maintenance guides
- Staining guides
- Price ranges
- Case studies
- Service area pages
- Dining deck / HOA pages
- Architect / GC pages

All outside paid persona split.

---

## 14. Recommendation Summary

1. Keep persona split in Paid LP only  
2. Keep SEO stack persona-neutral  
3. Use noindex/follow on Paid LP  
4. Do not mix navigation between systems  
5. Ensure canonical consistency
